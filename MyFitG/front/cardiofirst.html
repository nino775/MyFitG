            <h2>What to Do</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start with a Warm-Up:</strong> Begin with 5-10 minutes of light activity (e.g., brisk walking) to prepare your muscles and joints for cardio.</li>
                <li><strong>Choose a Beginner-Friendly Exercise:</strong> Start with low-impact options like walking, cycling, or using the elliptical to ease into cardio.</li>
                <li><strong>Pace Yourself:</strong> Maintain a comfortable, steady pace. Aim for a conversation-level intensity to avoid overexertion.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on Form:</strong> Maintain good posture and avoid leaning too heavily on machines. This helps reduce strain and improves effectiveness.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink water before, during, and after your cardio session to stay hydrated.</li>
                <li><strong>Cool Down:</strong> Gradually slow down and end with light stretching to help your body recover and reduce muscle soreness.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="dont-section">
            <h2>What Not to Do</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Warm-Up:</strong> Jumping straight into intense cardio increases the risk of muscle strain and injury.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Overdo It:</strong> Avoid pushing too hard on your first day. Start slow and gradually increase intensity over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Hold Your Breath:</strong> Breathe steadily and rhythmically throughout your cardio to ensure good oxygen flow.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Comparing Yourself to Others:</strong> Focus on your own progress and goals rather than comparing your endurance or speed with others.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Use Too Many Machines:</strong> Stick to one or two machines per session to avoid overtraining. Consistency is more important than variety at the start.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Ignore Pain:</strong> If you feel pain, stop immediately. Discomfort from exertion is normal, but pain could indicate injury.</li>
            </ul>
