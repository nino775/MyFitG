            <h2>What to Do</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Warm Up Properly:</strong> Spend 5-10 minutes warming up to prepare your muscles and joints for exercise.</li>
                <li><strong>Start with Light Weights:</strong> Begin with manageable weights to avoid injury and focus on mastering your form.</li>
                <li><strong>Ask for Help:</strong> If you're unsure about using a machine or performing an exercise, don't hesitate to ask gym staff for assistance.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Bring a water bottle and drink regularly to stay hydrated during your workout.</li>
                <li><strong>Follow a Plan:</strong> Have a simple workout plan in place, whether it's a basic circuit, cardio routine, or beginner strength training.</li>
                <li><strong>Cool Down and Stretch:</strong> Finish your workout with a cool-down period and some stretching to help prevent soreness.</li>

            <h2>What Not to Do</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Warm-Up:</strong> Avoid jumping straight into heavy exercises without warming up, as it increases the risk of injury.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Overdo It:</strong> Start slow and avoid pushing too hard on your first day. Your body needs time to adapt.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Compare Yourself to Others:</strong> Focus on your own progress and goals rather than comparing yourself to more experienced gym-goers.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Holding Your Breath:</strong> Breathe steadily during exercises to maintain proper oxygen flow and avoid dizziness.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Use Your Phone Excessively:</strong> Stay focused and avoid long distractions. Rest briefly between sets but keep your focus on the workout.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Poor Form:</strong> Don’t sacrifice form for heavier weights. Proper form is key to avoiding injuries and seeing progress.</li>
            </ul>
