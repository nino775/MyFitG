            <h2>Why Power Yoga is Good for You</h2>
            <p>Power yoga is a high-intensity workout that combines traditional yoga poses with cardio, offering numerous benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Builds Strength:</strong> Power yoga incorporates body-weight resistance, building strength and muscle tone.</li>
                <li><strong>Increases Flexibility:</strong> The dynamic stretching in power yoga enhances flexibility over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Boosts Cardiovascular Health:</strong> The faster pace keeps the heart rate up, promoting cardiovascular fitness.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduces Stress:</strong> Like other forms of yoga, power yoga reduces stress by incorporating mindful breathing and relaxation techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Improves Balance and Coordination:</strong> The challenging poses in power yoga improve body control, balance, and coordination.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Warnings: What Not to Do in Power Yoga</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Avoid Pushing Beyond Your Limits:</strong> Power yoga is intense, so listen to your body and avoid pushing too far, especially if you're new to yoga.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Warm-Up:</strong> Even in yoga, a gentle warm-up prepares your muscles for challenging poses, reducing injury risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on Form Over Speed:</strong> Rushing through poses can lead to poor form and injuries. Maintain control and focus on alignment.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Holding Your Breath:</strong> In power yoga, steady breathing is essential to maintain balance and stamina throughout the session.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Ignore Your Body’s Signals:</strong> If you feel pain or discomfort, ease out of the pose. Yoga should challenge you but not hurt.</li>
            </ul>
