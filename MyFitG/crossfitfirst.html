            <h2>What to Do</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Warm Up Properly:</strong> CrossFit workouts can be intense, so start with a proper warm-up to prepare your muscles and joints.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on Technique:</strong> Begin with lighter weights and master proper form and technique to avoid injury.</li>
                <li><strong>Follow a Scaled Workout:</strong> Many CrossFit exercises can be scaled down to suit beginners. Don’t be afraid to modify movements.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> CrossFit workouts are high-intensity, so be sure to drink water before, during, and after your session.</li>
                <li><strong>Listen to Your Coach:</strong> Coaches provide valuable feedback on form and modifications. Pay attention to their advice.</li>
                <li><strong>Cool Down and Stretch:</strong> Finish with a cool-down and stretching to help your body recover and reduce soreness.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- What Not to Do Section -->
        <section class="dont-section">
            <h2>What Not to Do</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Don’t Overdo It:</strong> CrossFit is intense. Start slowly, and don’t push yourself to exhaustion on your first day.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Skip the Warm-Up:</strong> Jumping into high-intensity exercises without warming up increases the risk of injury.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Competing with Others:</strong> Focus on your own progress and avoid comparing yourself to experienced CrossFitters.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Ignore Pain:</strong> If you feel sharp or unusual pain, stop immediately. There’s a difference between discomfort and injury.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Sacrifice Form for Speed:</strong> CrossFit often involves timed workouts, but always prioritize good form over speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Forget Recovery:</strong> Allow your body to rest and recover, especially after an intense CrossFit session.</li>
            </ul>
