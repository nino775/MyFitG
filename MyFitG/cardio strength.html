            <h2>Warnings: What Not to Do in Cardio & Strength Training</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Avoid Overtraining:</strong> Give your muscles time to recover to avoid injury and burnout. Schedule rest days.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Ignore Warm-Up:</strong> Proper warm-up prepares muscles and joints for intense training, reducing the risk of strains.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on Proper Form:</strong> Poor form during strength exercises can lead to injuries. Focus on technique over lifting heavier weights.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Skip Cool-Down:</strong> Cooling down helps muscles relax and prevents soreness after intense cardio and strength sessions.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Comparing Yourself to Others:</strong> Progress at your own pace; pushing too hard too soon can cause injuries.</li>
