            <h2>Warnings: What Not to Do in Weight Lifting</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Avoid Lifting Too Heavy, Too Soon:</strong> Start with manageable weights to prevent injury, and gradually increase as you progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Skip Warm-Up:</strong> A proper warm-up is essential to prepare muscles and joints for lifting, reducing the risk of strain.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on Form:</strong> Always prioritize proper technique over the amount of weight lifted. Poor form can lead to serious injuries.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Holding Your Breath:</strong> Use a steady breathing pattern to maintain stability and reduce strain on your cardiovascular system.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t Rush:</strong> Lifting weights too quickly reduces effectiveness and increases the risk of injury. Controlled movements are key.</li>
